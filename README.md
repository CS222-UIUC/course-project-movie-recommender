# Movie-Recommender

(1) Summary of the presentation: 

This presentation is about introducing the project “movie recommender” we did during this semester. The purpose of this project was to recommend movies by recollecting the user’s movie taste. There are different technical approaches used in this project that are mostly related to python (pandas) library for extracting the data and additionally using python to create a user interface, which visually requests the user for their input and output. By making the interface, it is actually possible for users to read the questions that we have provided and see our movie preferences that we provided to the user. 

(2) Describes technical architecture: 

There are two big processes for creating a movie recommender. First of all, it was about creating an interface. It is always important for the user to visually understand how the system is operating. We created a user interface by using python. We have used functions for asking users different questions about the movie. Afterwards, we have been using the user input to match it with the data we have extracted. The most part, we have been using askstring to create questions. Second of all, we have extracted the data by using the csv file related to each of the movie films. We tried to find the relationship between the movies by creating several functions. The more one movie had common features with another movie, that shows that the programmer will be able to recommend the other movie to the user. Then, we were able to use this data when user types in their movie taste using the user interface we have created. After that process, we have been able to put that in a program that contains all of the data we have extracted. Finally, we have merged that data inside the user interface, so we are now able to visually create the real movie recommendation.

We chose to use Python as our programming language for this project. For creating a movie recommendation system, we have first found the csv file for accessing the data. We have been searching for reliable files that we can use for this project. Then, we have been using the Pandas library to create some functions we need for extracting the data. The functions each were used to accumulate the relation between the movies. Afterwards, we were able to operate a program using the data. We also have created a user interface later to display the input and output visually. We also have been using python for creating the user interface since we knew that we needed to merge the data to the interface. Finally, we have merged the data we have extracted to the user interface we have created. 

(4) Group members and their roles : 

Each of the group members were assigned to do different tasks based on their preference. For the first couple of weeks, we worked on it together since we believed that it is important to gather our knowledge to build the structure of the project. We all have been focusing more on extracting the data by using Pandas library. Since we were all used to using that, we were able to structure and accumulate the data that we wanted. After a few weeks, we had been doing our individual work. Cristian and Hojoon had been focusing on creating and developing the user interface. We believe that it is important to provide a readable interface. So, the two of the group members were focusing on the part. Also, Sean and Hangoo were focusing on extracting the real data based on the file (csv) that we cumulated. This was the core part of the project since it is used for recommending the movie to the users. After we finished our task, we then tried to merge the data we had extracted to the interface. Since we were all using the python programming language, it was manageable to merge the data into the interface.
